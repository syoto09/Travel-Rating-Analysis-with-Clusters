# Travel Rating Analysis with Clusters

## Abstract

This study analyzed the travel rate reviews on destinations in 10 categories across East Asia. We used the cluster method to analyze the user's preference similarity. This method can divide the same group into similar and different groups with dissimilarities. We found the four other groups based on travel preferences and similarities of each user to recommend the sightseeing place.
